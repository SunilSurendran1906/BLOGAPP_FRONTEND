The Blockpedia web application provides a secure platform for users to register new accounts with full AUTHENTICATION, ensuring the safeguarding of user privacy. Within the application, users can create new blocks through a dedicated page. Once a block is created, users have the flexibility to edit or delete it, granting them complete control over their content.

Moreover, users enjoy comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within their blocks, empowering them to manage and organize their information efficiently. The application fosters user interaction by enabling visits to other users' blocks, facilitating the simultaneous viewing of multiple blocks within the same site.

To ensure data persistence and accessibility, user information is stored in a MongoDB database, offering a reliable foundation for future use. This robust architecture enhances the overall user experience, combining privacy protection, content management, and seamless data storage.
